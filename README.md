# :blossom: Wallflower :blossom:

### Progress: Currently in refactoring mode.

What began as an application that had no backend database is now being built into a full-stack application with python/django, postgreSQL, and JWT/Djoser authentication to support.

Here is a peak at the frontend/React landing page prior to signing up for the application. This is a snippet of the visual UX/UI of the work in progress...

This below is a peak at the application itself and the interactive qualities behind it.

This README.md will be updated upon completion on the refractoring of the application.

Keep checking back for updates!
